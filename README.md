making an e-commerce sit for my portfolio using MERN stack

react-helmet-async : sets the title of webpage for me
react-bootstrap : quick UI components that use bootstrap
use-reducer-logger : used to log state changes when using useReducer instead os useState

useContext: basically makes a global state that is accessible by anything thats within it's children
